rfl-init
========

Linux-specific init scripts and code for the rift project.

Given an existing linux distribution with
the OS-independent `rift` stuff installed,
this will populate `/etc` with the necessary scripts to boot.

Subdirectory `sysinit` contains the initscripts proper
(run once at system boot).
